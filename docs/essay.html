            <h4>Reflection Post</h4>
            <p> The most significant changes for learning to code with GitHub Pages would be literally learning the language that comes with coding in HTML.
                It was definitely a challenge and was a very big barrier that I did not really see in WordPress.
                I would say WordPress has the advantage when it comes to user-friendliness.
                Each website developer has its own challenges when looking at modifying layout and organization. 
                GitHub Pages has you manually make pages and tabs. 
                When you do anything in GitHub Pages you must start from scratch.
                It was difficult for me to organize my GitHub website because I did not totally understand all of the language that would have allowed me to.
                WordPress gives you less freedom than GitHub Pages.
                This can be a good thing and a bad thing.
                WordPress gives you less choice in the layout of your site.
                For example, WordPress only gives two options when displaying photos in a gallery, either as a slideshow or as a three-by-three grid of photos.
                I plan to use WordPress and not GitHub Pages.
                I would like to learn how to manually change things in WordPress though, just so I have this option in the future.</p>
